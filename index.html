                    <p>
                        I am an apprentice at Nashville Software School learning full-stack web development. 
                        Prior to starting at NSS, I worked as an accountant but did not have a passion for what
                        I did day to day. The exact opposite is true about my journey towards becoming a web developer.
                        Each day has brought exciting challenges and growth opportunities as well as friendships 
                        with others of similar backgrounds and experiences.

                    Rigorous full-time software development bootcamp concentrated on full stack
                    development essentials and problem solving. Front-end development focused on
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React. Back-end development was centered around jQuery, C#, .NET and SQL.

                <p>
                    My role at Marquee Dental Partners was to assist the controller 
                    and accounting manager with daily accounting operations revolving 
                    around over 30 dentistries spanning 4 states. We were a small team 
                    responsible for handling bookkeeping via Quickbooks for each Location
                    and also for preparing quarterly financial statements. Additionally, we 
                    performed our own internal auditing to ensure that data seemed reasonable
                    and valid.

                    At Edmondson, Betzler & Dame I worked as both a tax and audit accountant.
                    I assisted the firm's partners with audits that includedbanks, housing & 
                    urban development (HUD), food industry, and Not for Profit Organizations.
                    During tax season, and sometimes during the rest of the year, I worked on 
                    tax returns for individuals, corporations & partnerships. Additionally, I 
                    aided in the production of financial statements for certain clients under 
                    the supervision of the partners.

                <p>
                    When I graduated High School in 2009, I began working with my father in his 
                    custom residential home construction business, DeVault Homes. For some time 
                    I worked cleaning around the job sites, getting supplies for lots, and operating 
                    our Bobcat machine. Eventually, I was given the responsibility of communicating
                    with our subcontractors and setting up the schedules for the houses.

                                Front-end capstone - week twelve. I utilized HTML, CSS, JS, React, Material UI, 
                                Sketchboard and dbdiagram.io while working on this project. Board and Hoard is a single page

                                a library for each user. My objectives during this project included learning React (hooks in particular),
                                proper implementation of Material UI and revisiting front-end materials.

                                and ERD design. The purpose of this project was for us to implement what we had learned so far with regards to
                                handling user events, implementing CRUD operations, relational data and ERDs.
